Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions. This project aims to develop a KNN classifier that can identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on historical transaction data.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/knn-credit-card-fraud.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd knn-credit-card-fraud
Run the MATLAB Script:
Open the MATLAB environment and run the script knn_credit_card_fraud.m.

Data Preprocessing
The script performs data preprocessing steps, including checking for missing values, separating fraud and non-fraud transactions, and plotting transaction class distribution.

Finding the Optimal K
The script uses k-fold cross-validation to find the optimal value of K for the KNN algorithm.

Training the Model
The KNN model is trained using the optimal K, and the script displays the accuracy versus K plot.

Performance Measures
The performance of the KNN model is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix is also displayed.

Function Definitions
The README provides information about the custom functions used in the script, including the custom KNN function and the predict function.
